Crypto Tools
============

Some very simple tools built in order to complete an assessment as part of a Cryptography module for [my degree](https://www.kent.ac.uk/courses/undergraduate/183/computing--with-a-year-in-industry) at the [University of Kent](http://www.kent.ac.uk)

The tool is built using Jade, Sass, and CoffeeScript, and is most easily run using the Harp.js or by running the index.html page in /compiled in a web browser. Some features such as result retention won't work in browsers other than Google Chrome and its derivatives.
